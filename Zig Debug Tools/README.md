# Debug Tools for the Zig Template for Playdate
These are early attempts to integrate the Dear ImGui bindings from the [Zig Gamedev](https://github.com/zig-gamedev) github. It uses the [zig template]("https://github.com/DanB91/Zig-Playdate-Template"). So far it is working but requires some more effort to get it usable for actual games! If you want to try it out you have to install the PlaydateSDK and then just run zig build run on Zig master (0.14.0 latest).
